            <p>Hello, I am married and have one kid, I live in Madrid, Spain and love to go fishing and do outdoors activities, I had the chance to visit many different countries, more than 10 and I have learned from the different cultures and by knowing people arround, so another thing that I really love is to travel and get to konw other places and other people, which is somehow contrary to how I describe myself, I think of myself as a reserved person and enjoy more when other do the talking, however I like to just be arround. I hope to have the chance to visit several countries in Europe that I haven't visited yet and maybe to go across the mediterraneum and visit the north of Africa also. My wife and son also enjoy visiting places and traveling, we tend to like more staying several days in a place before moving on than just spending a day or so and the move along, I think is better to visit just one place at a time than several places in a short time, it feels like we are in a hurry.</p>
